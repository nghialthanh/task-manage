# Build user authentication in Golang with JWT and mongoDB

A simple Golang backend application that demonstrates the use of JWT tokens for users.


## Running Locally

Setup your .env file locally to hold the port and the DB connection string

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Joojo7/task-manage.git
$ cd task-manage
$ go build -o new -v 
$ ./new
```

The application should be available and running on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).
